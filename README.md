# Simple Calculator

Today we're going to write a simple calculator program. 

## Instructions

- In `calc.py`, ask the user to enter their first number, an operator, then their second number.
- Convert the numbers into integers or floats.
- Check what operator was chosen by the user.
- Print out the calculation with the operation that occurred.

## Supported Operators

- \+
- \-
- \*
- /
- **
- //
- %

## Example output

### Addition

```bash

Enter your num 1: 5
Enter your operator: +
Enter your num 2: 10

5 + 10 = 15

```

### Subtraction

```bash

Enter your num 1: 5
Enter your operator: -
Enter your num 2: 10

5 - 10 = -5

```

### Multiplication

```bash

Enter your num 1: 5
Enter your operator: *
Enter your num 2: 10

5 * 10 = 50

```

### Division 

```bash

Enter your num 1: 5
Enter your operator: /
Enter your num 2: 10

5 / 10 = 0.5

```

### Power 

```bash

Enter your num 1: 5
Enter your operator: **
Enter your num 2: 10

5 ** 10 = 9765625

```

### Integer Division

```bash

Enter your num 1: 5
Enter your operator: //
Enter your num 2: 2

5 // 2 = 2

```

### Modulo

```bash

Enter your num 1: 10
Enter your operator: %
Enter your num 2: 2

10 % 2 = 0

```

## Extra Credit

If you do any of these, mark an *x* in the square brackets on the left of the problem. For example, instead of [ ], it should be [x]. This will help us know that you did that problem.

- [ ] \[+5\] What happens when we try to divide by 0? Write code to fix this problem.
- [ ] \[+5\] If the user enters an invalid operator, print out a message informing the user that they entered an invalid operator. Print out the valid operators after.
